Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Analyze the district-wide standardized test results given every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Observable Trends:

The dataset was composed of data from 15 different schools, 39,170 total students, and a budget of $24,649,428. The average math score for all students was 79 and for reading it was 82. Though the scores were only 3 points off the percentage of those passing math, only 75% passing, and those passing reading, only 86% is a significant difference of 11%. The overall passing rate, where the students passed both math and reading with a score of 70 or higher, was only 65.2%.

After reviewing the data from the Highest-Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) and the Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) there seemed to be a correlation between the school type and total students. The top 5 schools were all Charters and had nearly half or less total students attending than the District Schools. The Per Student Budget did not seem to have any indicator whether the percent of students would pass overall, both math & reading with scores greater than 70.

Of the 15 schools, 7 are district and 8 are charter. The number of students in the schools ranged from 427 to 4976 students. The district schools all have more students than the charter schools.

An interesting finding was that as the Spending Ranges (Per Student) increased the average math scores, average reading scores, and overall passing percentages actually decreased. While resources and funding are essential this is clear that other factors play a more significant role in the math and reading results for students.

The small and medium sized schools were nearly the same with their students' results, with those passing math (94% & 94%), those passing reading (96% & 97%), and those passing overall (90% & 91%). While the large school size seemed to have a significant drop off in achievement with those passing math (70%), those passing reading (83%), and those passing overall (58%). A difference of just over 30% overall passing rate is something that should be looked at more closely and the district should make adjustments as needed to help support these students at the larger schools. 

As discussed early, the charter schools have a similar experience over the district schools with an overall passing rate of 90% vs the 53% at the district schools.
